      <h2>Gemini</h2>
      <p>If your birthday is this week, your friends will collect money to offer you
      a <strike>face surgery</strike> e-trip to Bali. There's a little bit of extra money, so you decide
      to help Guido look more Italian : you buy him a golden chain, a broad collar shirt and two rings for his pinkies.
      Consequently, you end the #pinkiesmatter movement and bring back peace to the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-white">
      <h2>Aries</h2>
      <p>You'll do everything you can so that people call you "The snake"
      but Sonia will keep on calling you "The worm".</p>
      <a href="images/star_wars_gif.gif" class="link-medium">Find out what Sonia really thinks about you</a>
      </div>
      <div class="card-white">
      <h2>Roxy</h2>
      <p>You'll have a passionate debate about a SQL request with Gianluca and end up winning, congratulations ! You'll consequently be fired
      from Le Wagon though, and live the rest of your life building html-only and see the world in two dimensions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-white">
      <h2>Virgo</h2>
      <p>You'll only be able to speak Indonesian. Jackpot ! You'll get private classes with Sisi and
      build an app together about learning how to surf in 2 days. It's a best
    seller. You virtually become a millionaire but due to the Covid, the Internet and your bank die two days later.
  Well done though !</p>
